# Director

Director is an action/task management system designed to be intuitive and highly configurable.

Notable features include:
- Defining custom actions via Lua
- A library of relevant utility functions for use in code actions
- The ability to easily define presets for actions at runtime
- Saving action presets to disk
- Context menus for directory actions, file actions, and the customization of each

*Note that because of Director's design philosophy, very little out-of-the-box
functionality exists. Effective use of this plugin revolves around your implementation of code actions.
See Configuration.md to learn how to write your own actions. You may also use my
[Neovim configuration](https://github.com/SamManibog/nvim/tree/main/lua/director_configs) for reference.*
